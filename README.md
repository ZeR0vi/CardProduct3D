# Introduction üöÄ
The requirements were: 
"When clicking on the 360¬∞ button, the page must display one of two options (according to your technical knowledge):

- Option 1: Swap the static image for the gif available at this link.

- Option 2: Swap the static image for a 3D model that can be navigable by dragging the mouse"

# Objective ü•§
The purpose of the project in my view is learning with the DOM, although it is something basic, many people still have difficulties in exchanging images using JavaScript
